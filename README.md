# The shape of things to come

## Quantifying the shape of plants with the Euler characteristic

This notebook is meant to be a first step introduction to compute Euler Characteristic Curves and the Euler Characteristic Transform for 2D and 3D images.  This repository includes the jupyter notebooks for the [2021 Annual Meeting of the NAPPN](https://www.nappn2021.org/agenda) to be held virtually, led by [Erik AmÃ©zquita](http://egr.msu.edu/~amezqui3). This introduction is tailored for a phenotyping plant biology audience, so the focus is on topological tools for image analysis.

These slides are written to be presented as [RISE slides](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html), however the notebook should be self contained without needing this installed. If you see a lot of weird cell toolbars in the notebook (which are used for controlling the slideshow version), these can be removed from your view of the jupyter notebook by going to View -> Cell Toolbar -> None
